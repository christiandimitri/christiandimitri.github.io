intro: I am a Lebanese Architect currently based in Barcelona, I have a competent experience varying from Architecture & Urban Design; Parametric Design in Architecture; Programming skills to develop custom grasshopper plugins; Web Design; I am also a self-learner by consisting my free time to learn the things I want through the web; I am passionate in the technology and the parametric processes for the construction by using visual programming and sometimes C# to develop custom tasks; enthusiastic about free-form surfaces in Architecture and how to rationalize them in order to be built them.
# languages-intro: Languages are the generators of our societies. Fortunatly I had a Bilingual childhood that made me assimilate and learn more languages in order to communicate with more people around the world.
